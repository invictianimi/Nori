# Status: NORI Project OS

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-13

## Current Phase

Planning

---

## Top 3 Priorities

1. Run `/Projects validate` to verify system integrity
2. Update SESSION_STATE.md with bootstrap results
3. Create session logs documenting initialization

---

## Next Action (<30m)

Run `/Projects validate` and verify all systems are healthy

**Why this matters:** Validation confirms the bootstrap was successful and the system is ready for operational use.

## Blockers

_None_

## Momentum Score

5

**Scale:**
- **5:** High momentum, making steady progress
- **4:** Good progress, minor friction
- **3:** Moderate progress, some challenges
- **2:** Slow progress, significant challenges
- **1:** Stalled or minimal progress

**Current Momentum:** 5 - Bootstrap in progress, all core components being initialized successfully.

## Cognitive Load

L

**Scale:**
- **S (Small):** Low mental effort, straightforward work
- **M (Medium):** Moderate complexity, requires focus
- **L (Large):** High complexity, mentally demanding

**Current Load:** L - System-level architecture and implementation requires significant focus.

## Recent Progress

✅ Directory structure validated and created
✅ Branding README created
✅ PROJECT_INDEX.md populated with 3 legacy projects
✅ BIG_IDEAS.md structured
✅ Governance files created (LIFECYCLE.md, VERSIONING.md)
✅ Project scaffold templates created (5 files)
✅ PROJECT_SERVICE_PROMPT.md fully implemented (10 commands)
✅ Legacy projects wrapped (ATAS, Certification-Center, KinderGuard)
✅ NORI-Project-OS self-instance created (dogfooding)

---

## Upcoming Milestones

- Complete bootstrap validation
- Achieve "OK" system health status
- Document any issues found during validation
- Close bootstrap session with complete logs

---

## Notes

This is NORI managing itself (dogfooding approach). Bootstrap initialization is approximately 90% complete. Final steps are validation, state updates, and logging.
