# Status: NORI Project OS

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-13

---

## Current Phase

Planning

---

## Top 3 Priorities

1. Test all `/Projects` commands interactively to verify functionality
2. Initialize git repository at NORI root for version control
3. Begin using NORI for daily project management (dogfooding)

---

## Next Action (<30m)

Begin using NORI daily (run `/Projects daily` each morning)

**Why this matters:** Real-world usage will validate workflows, identify friction points, and build muscle memory with the command system.

## Blockers

_None_

## Momentum Score

5

**Scale:**
- **5:** High momentum, making steady progress
- **4:** Good progress, minor friction
- **3:** Moderate progress, some challenges
- **2:** Slow progress, significant challenges
- **1:** Stalled or minimal progress

**Current Momentum:** 5 - Bootstrap complete! System validated and operational. Ready for daily use.

## Cognitive Load

L

**Scale:**
- **S (Small):** Low mental effort, straightforward work
- **M (Medium):** Moderate complexity, requires focus
- **L (Large):** High complexity, mentally demanding

**Current Load:** L - System-level architecture and implementation requires significant focus.

## Recent Progress

### Bootstrap Phase (Complete)
✅ Directory structure validated and created
✅ Branding README created
✅ PROJECT_INDEX.md populated with 4 projects (3 legacy + NORI itself)
✅ BIG_IDEAS.md structured
✅ Governance files created (LIFECYCLE.md, VERSIONING.md)
✅ Project scaffold templates created (5 files)
✅ PROJECT_SERVICE_PROMPT.md fully implemented (10 commands)
✅ Legacy projects wrapped (ATAS, Certification-Center, KinderGuard)
✅ NORI-Project-OS self-instance created (dogfooding)

### Testing Phase (100% Complete)
✅ Tested all 10/10 core `/Projects` commands successfully
✅ `/Projects daily` - Energy-based recommendations verified
✅ `/Projects validate` - System health checks passed (all OK)
✅ `/Projects idea add` + `/Projects idea list` - Idea management validated
✅ `/Projects new` + `/Projects archive` - Full lifecycle tested
✅ Confirmed all 4 projects properly scaffolded and compliant
✅ Archive-not-delete policy validated through test project

---

## Upcoming Milestones

- Complete bootstrap validation
- Achieve "OK" system health status
- Document any issues found during validation
- Close bootstrap session with complete logs

---

## Notes

This is NORI managing itself (dogfooding approach). Bootstrap initialization is 100% complete. System validated with OK status.

**Current Focus:** Priority #3 - Begin daily NORI usage (dogfooding). Command testing 100% complete (10/10). Git already configured and operational. System ready for production use.
