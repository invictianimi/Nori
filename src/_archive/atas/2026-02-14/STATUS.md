## Current Phase

Discovery

---

## Top 3 Priorities

1. Review existing project structure and MARC/ subfolder contents
2. Document current state and purpose of the project
3. Define desired outcomes and success metrics

---

## Next Action (<30m)

Review MARC/ folder structure and create initial inventory of existing files

**Why this matters:** Understanding what currently exists is the first step to defining next steps for this legacy project.

## Momentum Score

3

**Scale:**
- **5:** High momentum, making steady progress
- **4:** Good progress, minor friction
- **3:** Moderate progress, some challenges
- **2:** Slow progress, significant challenges
- **1:** Stalled or minimal progress

**Current Momentum:** 3 - Project just wrapped with NORI structure. Discovery phase starting.

## Cognitive Load

M

**Scale:**
- **S (Small):** Low mental effort, straightforward work
- **M (Medium):** Moderate complexity, requires focus
- **L (Large):** High complexity, mentally demanding

**Current Load:** M - Legacy project requires exploration and understanding before action.

---

## Recent Progress

- NORI wrapper files added (PROJECT.md, STATUS.md, DECISIONS.md, RISKS.md, README_NORI.md)
- Required folders created (logs/, kb/, artifacts/)
- Project registered in NORI registry

---

## Upcoming Milestones

- Complete initial discovery and documentation
- Define project purpose and desired outcomes
- Establish clear next steps

---

## Notes

This is a legacy project being brought under NORI management. The existing MARC/ subfolder contains the original project files which should be preserved as-is during discovery.
