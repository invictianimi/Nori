## Decision Categories

Decisions can be categorized as:

- **Architectural:** System design, technology choices, structural patterns
- **Process:** Workflow, methodology, governance changes
- **Scope:** What's in/out of scope, feature prioritization
- **Risk:** Risk acceptance, mitigation strategy choices
- **Resource:** Budget, time, people allocation
- **Technical:** Implementation details, library choices, algorithms

---

## Decision Review

Decisions should be reviewed when:
- Significant new information emerges
- Assumptions underlying the decision change
- The decision proves problematic in practice
- A major phase transition occurs

**Review Process:**
1. Reference the original decision entry
2. Create a new decision entry with "Review:" prefix
3. Note what changed and why
4. Update or supersede the original decision
5. Log the review in project logs

---

## Governance

- **Logging Required:** All significant decisions must be logged
- **Minimal Edits:** Append new decisions; don't rewrite history
- **Reversal is OK:** If a decision is reversed, log it as a new decision
- **Owner Accountability:** Decision owner is responsible for implementation oversight
- **Link to Changes:** Decisions should reference related code/doc changes

---

## Notes

Decisions are append-only. If a decision was wrong, add a new decision that reverses it.

This creates a learning trail, not a perfect history.
