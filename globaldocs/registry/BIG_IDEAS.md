<!-- Template for new ideas:

### NORI Mobile Companion App

- **Date Added:** 2026-02-13
- **Why it matters:** Quick project status checks on mobile devices would enable on-the-go project management and daily check-ins
- **First Tiny Step (<30m):** Research mobile frameworks (React Native vs Flutter) and assess feasibility
- **Promotion Criteria:** If mobile access becomes a frequent need (>3x per week for 2 weeks) or if travel requires mobile project tracking
- **Notes:** Low priority for now, but captures the idea for future consideration

## Promoted to Projects

_Ideas that became projects (preserved for continuity)_

<!-- When an idea is promoted:
1. Move it here from Inbox
2. Add Project Slug and Promotion Date
3. Link to the project folder
4. Keep original idea content intact
-->

_No promotions yet_

---

## Archived Ideas

_Ideas that were explored but not pursued (preserved for learning)_

<!-- When archiving an idea:
1. Move it here from Inbox
2. Add Archive Date and Reason
3. Keep original content intact
4. Archive = learning, not failure
-->

_No archived ideas_

## Idea Management Guidelines

### Adding Ideas

Use `/project idea add` to capture new ideas interactively, or manually add using the template above.

### Promoting Ideas

Promotion = transforming an idea into a full NORI project.

Process:
1. Verify promotion criteria are met
2. Run `/project new` (prefilled with idea content)
3. Move idea from Inbox → Promoted section
4. Add project slug and promotion date
5. Log the promotion

### Archiving Ideas

Archive when:
- Idea is no longer relevant
- Better alternative found
- Resource constraints prevent pursuit
- Exploration revealed it's not viable

**Never delete ideas.** Archive preserves learning and prevents idea recycling.

---

## Governance

- **Archive-not-delete:** Ideas must never be deleted, only archived
- **Idea template compliance:** All inbox ideas should follow the template structure
- **Promotion tracking:** All promoted ideas must link to their project
- **Logging:** All promotions and archives must be logged
