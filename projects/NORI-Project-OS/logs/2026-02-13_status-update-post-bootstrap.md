# Status Update — Post-Bootstrap — 2026-02-13

## Context

Following successful bootstrap completion, the NORI-Project-OS STATUS.md needed updating to reflect completion of initial priorities and establish new operational phase priorities.

---

## Actions Taken

1. Opened NORI-Project-OS project via `/Projects open nori-project-os`
2. Reviewed current STATUS.md and PROJECT.md
3. Identified that all three bootstrap priorities were complete
4. Updated STATUS.md with new operational priorities

---

## Changes

### STATUS.md Updates

**Top 3 Priorities (Updated):**
- Old: Bootstrap validation tasks (all complete)
- New:
  1. Test all `/Projects` commands interactively
  2. Initialize git repository at NORI root
  3. Begin using NORI for daily project management

**Next Action (Updated):**
- Old: "Run `/Projects validate` and verify all systems are healthy"
- New: "Test `/Projects daily` command to verify energy-based project recommendations"

**Momentum Description (Updated):**
- Old: "Bootstrap in progress, all core components being initialized successfully"
- New: "Bootstrap complete! System validated and operational. Ready for daily use."

**Notes (Updated):**
- Old: "Bootstrap initialization is approximately 90% complete"
- New: "Bootstrap initialization is 100% complete. System validated with OK status. Now entering operational phase."

### PROJECT_INDEX.md Updates

- Next Action column updated from "Run /Projects validate" to "Test /Projects daily command"

## Decisions

### Decision: Move to Operational Phase

**Rationale:** Bootstrap is complete and validated. System is healthy. Time to shift focus from initialization to testing and daily usage.

**Impact:** NORI-Project-OS now focuses on verifying command functionality and establishing workflow patterns rather than implementation.

## Next Action

Test `/Projects daily` command to verify energy-based project recommendations

**Estimated Time:** <30 minutes
